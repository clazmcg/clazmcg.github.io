          The Couch <br> <br>
A witty little article about a couch and the struggle several people went through to get it to it's rightful place. This little incident seemed to humor murmur and tao, so i thought i'd tell it to the rest of the zine community.
<br><br>
It was a Wednesday after i had just finished eating lunch at Arby's with the rest of my crew (quarex, swiss pope, etc). we were walking back to normal community high school when i noticed an enormous couch sitting by a dumpster turned on it's side. As when anyone would do when they see a couch, i yelled:
<br><br>
"hey guys! look! a cOuch!@#
<br><br>
After pointing this out to everyone, we went and closely examined the in questioned couch. It looked nice. no cushions though. Didn't seem to contain any sort of insects. So, we picked it up and began walking back towards school. As we were walking back, we decided to take a little rest and set it down in the middle of this open lot. When we set it down, for some reason, some people began to throw walnuts at us. you can tell how much we are liked at our high school. After a little rest we started back towards school again. (sidenote: i wasn’t carrying the couch at this point) to get to school though, the couch had to be carried across two lanes of really fast traffic. So the people now carrying the couch waited a minute or so before carrying the couch across the street. 
<br><br>
Quarex and company continued to carry the now famous couch, not letting fatigue get them down. After contimplating putting the couch in the front of the school, the destination was now clear -- the senior parking lot (in case some of you can't figure it out, this is where the senior's park their cars). The couch was then put into it's own parking space for the rest of the afternoon. Now if you haven't found _any_ humor in this so far, just picture a lot full of cars and then a couch. If you're not laughing now then stop reading. Anyways, now that the couch had reached it's destination, the battle for who got the couch was next. I said it should have been mine, cause i saw it first, but other people said it should go to q's house cause it just rules. (it does, but i didn't care, i saw it first)
<br><br>
After school was out, we went to the parking lot, and surprisingly enough, the couch was still there. there was a problem though, how to get it home. I ride a moped, and q has a small car (well, not small, but not big enough for a couch). So we thought and thought for like 20 minutes trying oh so many things to get the couch in his car, but to no avail. we decided to leave it there in it’s parking space over night, not knowing what was going to happen to it. I thought it would be gone, but hey anything could happen.
<br><br>
It is now the next morning, and as i do everyday, i am freezing my butt off riding my moped to school. i get to school, and the couch is still there!@#this is amazing!@# so amazed, i decided to sit on it and read hamlet for like 15 minutes. The now famous couch resides in q's basement, finally getting some sort of a van to get it home. It is being given away on murmur and tao's radio show this weekend, so maybe even _you_ could own this couch.
